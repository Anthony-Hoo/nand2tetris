# Nand2tetris

 This is a repo of the project in the book The Elements of Computing Systems.

## Finished

These projects below are the ones had been finished:

### Chapter 1 (project 01)

using  the `Nand gate` and the `composite gates` that build on top of it to implement the other gates, such as  the `And gate` , the `Not gate` , the `Or gate` , the `Xor gate` ,  the `Multiplexor` and the `Demultiplexor` in different *ways* and *bit-width*. 

### Chapter 2 (project 02)

using the gate built in the formal units to imply the combined logical circuit like the `half-adder`, the `full-adder`, the `16-bit adder`, the `16-bit increaser`, and finally the `ALU`.

### Chapter 3 (project 03)

using the Data flip-flop(DFF) to build sequential logic circuit and joint them with  combined logical circuit, and imply the circuit like the `Bit-register`, the `register`, the `n-bits RAM` and the `n-bit counter`.
